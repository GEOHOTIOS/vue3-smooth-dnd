  Vue 3 Wrapper of smooth-dnd library.
  <br/>
  <a href="https://gilnd.github.io/vue3-smooth-dnd" target="__blank"><b>Live demo<b></a>
</p>

> NOTE: This is a Vue 3 wrapper over [smooth-dnd](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/smooth-dnd) library. It's a fork of the already done [vue2 wrapper](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/vue-smooth-dnd) done by the original author of the library.

All the [documentation](https://github.com/kutlugsahin/vue-smooth-dnd/blob/master/README.md) for the Vue 2 version works with this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-smooth-dnd) version too!
    
## Install
```bash
yarn add vue3-smooth-dnd
```

> Note: this project is still in WIP!
